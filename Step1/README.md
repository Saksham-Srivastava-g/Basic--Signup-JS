## 🧠 What I Learned

This project was part of my journey to master the **JavaScript DOM** through **project-based learning**. Through this, I practiced and deeply understood:

- DOM element selection and manipulation (`querySelector`, `textContent`, etc.)
- Form events (`submit`, `input`, `focus`)
- Event object usage
- Data validation using JS
- LocalStorage for data persistence
- JSON operations (`JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()`)
- Conditional rendering and state logic
- Structuring user input in array of objects
